# Avalanche Report [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/avalanche-report/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/avalanche-report) [![github actions badge](https://github.com/kellpossible/avalanche-report/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kellpossible/avalanche-report/actions?query=workflow%3ARust+branch%3Amain+)

A simple self-hosted web server for creating and managing an avalanche forecast for a region, along with accepting public observations.

Current deployments:

* [avalanche.ge](https://avalanche.ge)
* [bansko.avalanche.bg](https://bansko.avalanche.bg)

Currently it uses a Google Sheet [Avalanche Forecast Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vkav8SNr4uv1sOtc6mp2eTDa7nYTj5k852T1rD8F_8Y/edit?usp=sharing) for forecast data entry. Forecasts are placed in a specific google drive folder when they are ready to be published, and are automatically picked up by the server and rendered as HTML to users.

There is a blog post which explains the inception, history and motivations for this project: [Introducing `avalanche-report`](https://lukefrisken.com/code/introducing-avalanche-report/).

## Translations

Translations for the project are happening over at <https://crowdin.com/project/avalanche-report>. Many thanks to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) for supporting this project with an open source license! Contributions are very welcome. If you wish to contribute feel free to contact me <a href="mailto:l.frisken@gmail.com">l.frisken@gmail.com</a>, [Post an Issue](https://github.com/kellpossible/avalanche-report/issues) or [Create a discussion](https://github.com/kellpossible/avalanche-report/discussions). We will need to verify that you have the required technical avalanche knowledge (or close access to) needed to make accurate translations, as this is a safety critical product.

## Design Considerations

The following are goals that the project is striving to acheive (or has already achieved and needs to maintain) through careful decision making during the design process.

1. Self contained with all the basics needed to run an avalanche forecasting service website.
2. Accessible.
  * Designed from the ground-up to be translated into multiple languages.
  * Should work with minimal client system requirements.
  * Should work well on a poor internet connection.
3. Reliable.
  * Avalanche forecasts are an important public service.
  * The only likely point of failure should be the host itself.
  * Budget for on-call tech support is limited.
4. Simple.
  * It should be easy to install and operate from an administrative perspective.
  * Avalanche professionals or enthusiasts are for the most part not necessarily professional server administrators or software engineers.
  * From this perspective, the server is a single self-contained binary that is dead easy to install and run on any computer/web server.
  * A docker container is also provided.
  * The database is using [`sqlite`](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), which is embedded into the application (no need for a separate service), and the data consists of a single file.
  * Database backup and restore functionality is built into the application.
5. Cost effective.
  * It should be cheap to develop, cheap to deploy, cheap to run.

## Setup

### Building from Source

To build the software yourself should have the following tools installed on your computer and available in your path:

+ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
+ [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
+ (optional, for development) [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner.

The following command will build the software in release mode:

```bash
npm install && \
npx tailwindcss --input src/style.css --output dist/style.css && \
cargo run --release -p migrations && \
DATABASE_URL="sqlite://data/db.sqlite3" cargo build --release
```

The final output is a self-contained static binary at `target/release/avalanche-report` (or `target\release\avalanche-report.exe` on Windows), which you can then take and run. All the required assets are embedded into the binary, this is all you need to run the server.

The following can be added to your `.env` file to make it easier to run various cargo commands without the DATABASE_URL environment variable:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="sqlite://data/db.sqlite3"
```

For convenience, there is also a docker container [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) based on [`alpine` linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) which you can build with:

```bash
$ docker build .
```

### Dockerhub

Docker images for this project are published to dockerhub <https://hub.docker.com/r/lfrisken/avalanche-report> with the name `lfrisken/avalanche-report`. You can use either the `latest` tag, or a tag for a specific git commit version.

See <https://github.com/kellpossible/avalanche-bg-avalanche-report> for an example of customizing and deploying avalanche-report using this dockerhub image.

## Running

### Configuration

Configuration for the `avalanche-report` software makes use of [`toml-env`](https://github.com/kellpossible/toml-env). You can create a `.env.toml` file in your working directory with the following available options, all are optional except those denoted as `(REQUIRED)` in the comment:

```toml
# All values in this top section are also values which can be configured as 
# environment variables with the same name:

# Set the logging.
# Default: `warn,avalanche_report=info`
RUST_LOG="warn,avalanche_report=info"


# Options can be specified by prepending them with `AVALANCHE_REPORT__` and
# with names in uppercase
# See `[AVALANCHE_REPORT]` for available options and their defaults.
# This can be useful for variables like the following which you may want to
# specify using your deployment platform's secret storage capability:
AVALANCHE_REPORT__ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH="SECRET"
# This variable is within the `backup` scope, so it has an extra `BACKUP__`:
AVALANCHE_REPORT__BACKUP__AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="SECRET"

# Contains the options in TOML format as a multiline string, normally you
# would use this as an alternative to `.toml.env` file. Options specified
# here are without the `[AVALANCHE_REPORT]` wrapping scope. See `fly.toml`'s
# `env.AVALANCHE_REPORT` key for an example of this. See all values inside 
# `[AVALANCHE_REPORT]` for examples of available configuration options.
