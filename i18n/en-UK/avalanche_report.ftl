    This project is run by _Zvavi Saqartvelo - Avalanche Georgia_, a registered
    non-profit NGO, which has started an avalanche forecasting service in the
    Republic of Georgia. We provide free, high-quality information and warnings
    about avalanche conditions in the Gudauri area, which is a popular location
    for off-piste and backcountry freeriding and ski touring. We heavily rely
    on the contributions of volunteers and donors, and welcome anyone who is
    interested to help further the project. 
    You can contact us via email [zvavisaqartvelo@gmail.com](mailto:zvavisaqartvelo@gmail.com)
